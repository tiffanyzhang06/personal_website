    <p id = 'main'>Hello! My name is Tiffany Zhang, and I am currently a second-year student at Northeastern University studying 
        Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Fintech. I'm particularly interested in exploring and 
        applying data analytics, machine learning, and business strategy to drive innovation and support informed decision-making 
        in the financial technology industry. So far, I’ve gained hands-on experience through projects where I used tools like SQL 
        and Python to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets. I’ve worked with topics such as public health and sales 
        performance, using data to uncover trends and generate insights that help support informed business and policy decisions. 
        In the future, I hope to apply my knowledge to develop data-driven solutions that make finance more efficient, transparent, 
        and accessible. I’m especially excited about how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and predictive modeling 
        can drive meaningful innovation in the fintech industry. Outside of school, I enjoy going on walks, listening to music, and 
        exploring new places with my family and friends. Thank you for checking out my website!</p>
